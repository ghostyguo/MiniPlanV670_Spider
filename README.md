# MiniPlanV670_Spider

This is a project for the 18 axes spider robot using MiniPlan_V670 board. The PC program RobotFun written in C# communicates with the MiniPlanV670_Test by the WiFi connection. Because SoftwareSerial is not good for ESP8266, the bluetooth control is not test OK in current version.
